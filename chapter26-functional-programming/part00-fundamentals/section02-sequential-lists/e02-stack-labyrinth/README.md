##### Exercise 2: [Solving the labyrinth](e02-stack-labyrinth)
Given a labyrinth represented by an NxN matrix, write a program that finds a way from a given input cell, to a given exit cell if there's a way or otherwise prints `'No possible way to the exit'`. Movements in the matrix should be according to the North, East, South, West directions, so that diagonal movements are not permitted.
