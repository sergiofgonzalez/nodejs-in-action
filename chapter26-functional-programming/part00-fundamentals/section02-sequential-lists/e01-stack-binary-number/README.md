##### Exercise 1: Getting the binary representation of a number
> Write a program that takes as an input a number in base 10 and returns  its representation in base 2.
Hint: you can find the binary representation of any given number in base 10 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 until the divisor is zero. The remainders of all those divisions will give you the binary number.
