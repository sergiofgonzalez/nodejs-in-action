# Part 2: Applications
## Chapter 19 &mdash; Amazon Web Services
### Section 8: Amazon S3 and Glacier
#### 01 &mdash; Amazon S3: *Amazon S3* from *AWS CLI*
> a collection of simple scripts illustrating how to interact with *Amazon S3* from the *CLI*.

The following actions are illustrated:
+ create bucket
+ blocking public access to a bucket
+ enabling AES-256 encryption on the bucket
+ enabling versioning on the bucket
+ uploading/copying files
+ downloading/retrieving files and specific versions
+ deleting specific versions
+ deleting the bucket

| NOTE: |
| :---- |
| Deleting the S3 bucket after having enabled versioning did not work. The only way to accomplish it was through the *AWS console*. |
