# e02 &mdash; Structuring a page of content
> Another exercise from [MDN: HTML basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Structuring_a_page_of_content) illustrating how to structure a page of content using the appropriate structural semantics.

## Description

For this example, you need to mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospectve PhD student concerning their application to the university.

Save the [initial resources](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/structuring-a-page-of-content-start/assets.zip?raw=true) that contain the HTML, CSS and images used on the page and follow the instructions below.

### Project description

The goal is to take the content for the homepage of a bird watching website and add the structural elements to it, so that it can have the appropriate layout applied to it.

It must have:
+ A header spanning the full width of the site containing the main title for the page, the site logo, and the navigation menu.<br>The title and logo will appear side by side once styling is applied, and the navigation will appear below those two items.

+ A main content area containing two columns &mdash; a main block containing the welcome text, and a sidebar containing image thumbnails.

+ A footer containing copyright information and credits

As a result, you will have to add mark up so that the final product features:
+ A header
+ A navigation menu
+ A main content area
+ The welcome text
+ A sidebar for images
+ The footer

Once the mark up is completed and validated, you can apply the provided CSS to validate that the page look like the image below:

### Additional guidelines

+ The [initial resources](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/structuring-a-page-of-content-start/assets.zip?raw=true) already include a well-constructed HTML that you should use as the starting point for the exercise. You just have to add additional semantic and structural elements to it.

+ Do not mind about the correct layout or CSS while marking up the document &mdash; once the mark up is done, you can link to the provided [CSS file from the resources](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/structuring-a-page-of-content-start/assets.zip?raw=true) and compare with the image above.

The page without CSS should look like this:
