        Dear Eileen,
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the
        University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
        of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one
        by one, in the following sections.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        <p>
          We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us
          at any time, however it would suit us better if you could
          start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for
          each one are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
          <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
          <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
        </ul>


        <p>
          Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start
          date you would prefer.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can find more information about
          <a title="Important University updates" href="http://www.example.com">important university dates</a>
          on our website.

        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

        <p>
          At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded
          research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere
          in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an
          intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of
          person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
          ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows,
          in order of priority:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Turning Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health
            benefits of Resveratrol
            (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
          </li>
          <li>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers
            at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F),
            when the audience size exponentially increases
            (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
            constructs for representing musical scores.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          So please can you provide more information on each of these
          subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to
          take, required staff and other resources, and anything else
          you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>

        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did
          study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my
          favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
          <dd>
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as
            far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around in a
            circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be
            "fruitful".
          </dd>

          <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
          <dd>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting
            warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved
            huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and
            shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,
            very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say
            that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as
            Twerking.
          </dd>

          <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
          <dd>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English
            explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance
            style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced
            by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it
            was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were
            really cold.
