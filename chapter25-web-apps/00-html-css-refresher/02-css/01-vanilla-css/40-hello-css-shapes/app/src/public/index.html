          One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat over their winter fire in the little
          French town of Annonay, watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names
          were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful
          minds and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery. Before that night—a memorable night,
          as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires without
          drawing any special inspiration from the fact.
