# 17 &mdash; Using `display: inline-block` in navigation bars
> illustrates how the effect of using `display: inline-block` in navigation bars, where it is found quite frequently.

In the example, we have a navigation row using `display: flex` and add three links to the bar.
In order for the links to occupy more space, we add some padding, but when doing so we see that the space seems to overflow to the container.

After applying `display: inline-block` we see how the situation gets fixed.

See the [details](../README.md#using-display-inline-block) in the concepts section.
