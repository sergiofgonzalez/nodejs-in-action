  <h1>Basic document flow</h1>

  <p>I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new lines below me.</p>

  <p class="positioned">
    By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and our height is as tall as our child content. Our
    total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height.
  </p>

  <p>We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are separated by the width of one of our margins,
    not both.</p>

  <p>inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and
    adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if
      possible â€” like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
    <img src="/images/long.jpg"></p>
