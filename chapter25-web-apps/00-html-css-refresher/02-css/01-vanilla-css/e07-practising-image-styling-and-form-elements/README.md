# e07 &mdash; Practising styling on images and form elements
> exercises on images, media, and form elements

## Description

This is the exercise [MDN: Test your skills: Images and Form elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Images_tasks)

It consists of a series of separate practices, on which you are given a fixed HTML document and you have to use CSS to get the desired final status on the page.


### Exercise 1

In this exercise, you have an image that is overflowing the box. We want to scale down the image to fit it inside the box without any extra whitespace, but we do not mind if some part of the image is cropped.

The final result should look like the following image:

### Exercise 2

In this exercise you have a form that you have to styly to modify how it looks:
+ use attribute selectors to target the search field and button inside `.myform`.
+ make the form field and button use the same text size as the rest of the form.
+ give the form field and button 10 pixels of padding
+ give the button a purple background, white foreground, no border and rounded corners of 5px.

The final result should look like the following:
