## Description

This is the exercise [MDN: Test your skills: The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Box_Model_Tasks)

It consists of a series of separate practices, on which you are given a fixed HTML document and you have to use CSS to do some changes.


Without changing the HTML, use CSS to:

### Exercise 1

With the given CSS and HTMl, in which we have a box following the standard model, and another using the alternative box model, add the necessary rules to the `.alternate` class so that it matches the visual width of the first box.

### Exercise 2

Add to the box:
+ a 5px, black, dotted border
+ a top margin of 20px
+ a right margin of 1em
+ a bottom margin of 40px
+ a left margin of 2em
+ padding on all sides of 1 em

### Exercise 3

In the initial state given the following CSS:

```css
.box span {
  background-color: pink;
  border: 5px solid black;
  padding: 1em;
}
```

the inline element has a margin, padding and border however the lines above and below are overlapping it.

Update the CSS so that the size of the margin, padding, and border are respected, while still keeping the element inline.
