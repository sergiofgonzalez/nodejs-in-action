> examples about how to style backgrounds and borders in CSS

## Description

This is the exercise [MDN: Test your skills: backgrounds and borders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Test_your_skills_backgrounds_and_borders)

It consists of a series of separate practices, on which you are given a fixed HTML document and you have to use CSS to do some basic styling.


### Exercise 1

Add a background, border and simple styling to a page header:
1. Give the box a 5px black solid border with rounded corners of 10px.
2. Add a background image (`ballooons.jpg`) and size it so that it covers the box.
3. Give the `<h2>` a semi-transparent black background color, and make the text white.

The final result should look like the following image:

### Exercise 2

Add background images, a border, and some additional styling to a decorative box.

+ Give the box a 5px lightblue border, and round the top left corner 20px and the bottom right corner 40px.
+ The heading must use the `star.png` image as a background image, with a single centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right.
+ Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it is centered, so that the final result looks like the image below:
