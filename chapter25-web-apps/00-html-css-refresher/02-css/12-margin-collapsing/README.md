# 12 &mdash; Margin collapsing
> illustrates the margin collapsing situation, when two elements have margins that touch.

In the example, we have a container with two paragraphs that have a `margin-bottom` and `margin-top` that overlaps and the margin collapses.

| The rules that dictate when margins do and do not collapse and how are somewhat complicated. You can find all the detailed information on [MDN: Mastering margin collapsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing).<br>For example, when setting a width and height for the container, margin collapse will not occur. |
