It consists of a series of exercises in which you are given fixed HTML documents and you practice how the grid and grid items behave.

### Exercise One

Create a grid into which the four child elements will *auto-place*. The grid should have three columns sharing the available space equally, and a 20-pixel gap between the column and row track.
