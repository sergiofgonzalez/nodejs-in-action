# 06 &mdash; Playing with type, class, and ID selectors
> practising selectors involving types, classes and ids.

## Description

In the example, we populated `styles.css` with rules that affect the given HTML document.

You can see the original aspect of the document removing the stylesheet link in the `<head>` of the document.

1. Give the `<span>` elements a yellow background
2. Give the `<strong>` elements a `rebeccapurple` background
3. Give the `<em>` elements also a `rebeccapurple` background
4. Remove the margins for all the elements of the document
5. Create a rule for the class `highlight` that will set a pink background on the elements that feature that class
6. Create a rule for the class `highlight` affecting only `<h2>` elements with that class.
7. Create rules for the elements with the `"notebox"` class that is used to style info, warning and danger boxes. The first one should style the element with a gray border, and a padding of `0.5em`. The warning box should feature an oranger border and text in bold. The danger box should feature a red border with text in bold.
8. Create a rule that will style an element with `id="one"` with green background, and an element with `id="two"` that is an `<h2>` with text in `rebeccapurple` color.
