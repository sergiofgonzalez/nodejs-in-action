> practising selectors with pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

## Description

In the example, we populated `styles.css` with rules that affect the given HTML document.

You can see the original aspect of the document removing the stylesheet link in the `<head>` of the document.

1. Make the first `<p>` in the `<article>` element a `font-size: 120%` and bold, without using a class.

2. Make that links visited or unvisited are styled in `rebeccapurple` and bold, while colored in pink while hovering over it.

3. Make that the first line of a paragraph to be styled in gray.

4. Make that the first line of the first paragraph to be styled with a green background.

5. Make that all paragraphs show a 📺 before the paragraph and a 👍 after the paragraph using CSS pseudo-elements.

6. use `::before` to create a 200px wide x 100px high blue square before any element styled with the `class="box"`.
