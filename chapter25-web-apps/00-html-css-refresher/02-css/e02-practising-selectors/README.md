## Description

This is the exercise [MDN: Test your skilss: Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Selectors_Tasks)

It consists on a series of separate practices, on which you are given a fixed HTML document and you have to use CSS to do some changes.


Without changing the HTML, use CSS to:

### Exercise 1: Selectors One

+ Make `<h1>` headings blue
+ Give `<h2>` headings a blue blackground and white text
+ Cause text wrapped in a span to have a font-size of 200%

### Exercise 2: Selectors Two

+ Give the element with `id="special"` a yellow background
+ Give the element with `class="alert"` a 1px grey border
+ If the element with a class `alert` also has a class `stop`, make the background red.
+ If the element with a class `alert` also has a class `go`, make the background green

### Exercise 3: Selectors Three

+ Style links, making the link-state orange, visited links green, and remove the underline on hover
+ Make the first element inside the container font-size: 150%, and the first line of that element red
+ Stripe every other row in the table by selecting these rows and giving them a background color of #333 and foreground of white

### Exercise 4: Selectors Four

+ Make any paragraph that directly follows an `<h2>` red
+ Remove the bullets and add a 1px gre bottom border only to list items that are a direct child of the `<ul>` with a class of list

### Exercise 5: Selectors Five

+ Target the `<a>` element with a title attribute and make the border pink
+ Target the `<a>` element with an `href` attribute that contains the word `"contact"` somewhere in its value and make the border orange
+ Target the `<a>` element with an `href` value starting with `https` and give it a green border
