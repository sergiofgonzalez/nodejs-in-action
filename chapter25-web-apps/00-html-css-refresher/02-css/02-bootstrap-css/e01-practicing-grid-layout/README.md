### Additional details and hints

#### Example 1

The main content should take 80% of the available width, with the sidebar taking the remaining 40%. Both elements should feature margin on both left and right, and the text contents should be centered both horizontally and vertically.

The two elements should stack on top of each other for screen sizes below 768px, but the container element should always feature the extra spacing on both sizes even below 768px.


Hint: Use semantic HTML for the columns instead of plain `<div>`s.

#### Example 2

Use nested tables to achieve the given layout. Do not mind about responsive design, alignment of content, and margins.

#### Example 3

Replicate the given layout using multiple column specs. See how the layout is rearranged when you resize the browser screen so that the layout changes from 1x12 cols, to 2x6 cols, to 3x4 cols, to 4x3 cols, to 6x2 cols, to 12x1.
