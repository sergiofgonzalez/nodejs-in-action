# e05 &mdash; Practising `overflow`
> exercises on the `overflow` property and its values

## Description

This is the exercise [MDN: Test your skills: Overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Overflow_Tasks)

It consists of a series of separate practices, on which you are given a fixed HTML document and you have to use CSS to get the desired overflow behavior.


### Exercise 1

Given a box on which text is overflowing because it has been set with fixed heigh, make the box to have scrollbars only if there is enough text to cause an overflow.


The final result should look like the following image:

### Exercise 2

The image below is bigger than the dimensions of the box, so it overflows visibly.

Change it so that any image outside the box is hidden.
