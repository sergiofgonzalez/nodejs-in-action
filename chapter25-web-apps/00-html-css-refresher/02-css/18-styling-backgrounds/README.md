![Background colors](docs/images/01_background_colors.png)

### Exercise 2 &mdash; background images

Change the CSS so that the element with `class="a"` is styled with the image `images/food_small.jpg`, the element with `class="b"` with the image `images/white_heart_small.png`, and the element with `class="c"` with `images/bomb.png`.

Add a background color to the latter.

Also, for the element with `class="d"` using `images/bomb.png` prevent the image from repeating.

Also, change the `background-size` property for `class="e"` element to fit the image on the box using `contain`.

Finally, style the element with `class="f"` so that it places the image 30px from the left edge, and right to the bottom of the box.
