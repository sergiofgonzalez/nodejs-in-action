# e01: Event Loop and Async behavior &mdash; Hello, `fetch`!
> a simple TypeScript client application that performs requests to external sites using `fetch`

## Description

This application is a rewrite of [01: Hello, XHR!](../01-hello-xhr) but using `fetch()` instead of `xhr`.

| NOTE: |
| :---- |
| In this exercise we're doing cross-origin requests, but those are allowed by the target site (https://openlibrary.org/). |
