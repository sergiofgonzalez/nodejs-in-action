# 01: Decorators &mdash; Hello, Decorator Factories!
> introduces decorator factories

## Description

The example illustrate the simplest decorator factory, that can be used to *enhance* the decorator concept so that it can receive additional arguments.

Note that there is no need to instantiate the class to see the `console.log` statements. Both lines will be printed in the console just by using the decorator.
