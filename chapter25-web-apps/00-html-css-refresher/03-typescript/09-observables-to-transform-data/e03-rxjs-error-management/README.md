# e03: Using *Observables* to transform data &mdash; Error Management in Observables
> Removing the deprecation from [04: Handling errors in *Observables*](../04-hello-rxjs-observable-errors)

In [04: Handling errors in *Observables*](../04-hello-rxjs-observable-errors) there is a deprecation error found in the way in which `subscribe()` is written. Fix it and update the code so that it works in the same way but using the new approach.

## Solution
The deprecation was fixed using the information from https://rxjs.dev/deprecations/subscribe-arguments.
