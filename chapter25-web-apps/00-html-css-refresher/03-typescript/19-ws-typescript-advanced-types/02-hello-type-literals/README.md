# 02: Advanced Types &mdash; Type literals
> introducing type literals

## Exercise 6.02

In this exercise you have to create a function that takes a string literal and returns a number literal.

1. Create two type literals for `'no'` and `0`.

2. Create a function `onlyNo()` that accepts the type literal defined for `'no'` and returns the type literal defined for `0`. Note that the function must return `0`.

3. Validate that the function works as expected by invoking it as `onlyNo()`.
